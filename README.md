"Count App" is a simple application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its purpose is straightforward: to count things. Users can interact with the app by clicking on buttons or using other input methods to increment or decrement the count. The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS to make it visually appealing and easy to use. JavaScript is used to handle the logic behind counting and updating the display in real-time.
